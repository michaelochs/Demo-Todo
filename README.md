# ToDo

This is a demo projcet, showing the very basic api use of CloudKit. This is by no means a fully designed api and should only illustrate the general CloudKit usage. It can be used as a starting point to experiment with CloudKit.

It is part of a talk I gave on 2014-12-15 in Cologne. For more info, please see [my blog](http://www.ios-coding.com/talks/).


## Installation

Run `pod install` and open the workspace.

Create a provisioning profile that has CloudKit enabled and ensure you are signing with this certificate.
